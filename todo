- impelement more robust contract tests;
    ActiveRecordScoreRepo#purchased_content wasn't implemented and it was hard to figure out why the app doesn't work
- choice either score_id or product id to refer to product
- decide if messages should have 'get' prefix on repos
- rename FakeScore to StubScore
- user_id comes first in FindScore#find
- rename PurchasedContent to ScoreContent

NOTES:

- type tests actually saved me a few times
